WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <inicio> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
WARNING:Xst:653 - Signal <estado_p> is used but never assigned. This sourceless signal will be automatically connected to value 00.
WARNING:Xst:646 - Signal <estado_f> is assigned but never used. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.
    Found 10x7-bit ROM for signal <display$mux0000>.
WARNING:Xst:737 - Found 7-bit latch for signal <display>. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.
INFO:Xst:2371 - HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
